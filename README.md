# microprocessor-in-Logisim
A school project that has been lying on the floor for a long time

Used program [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/ru/index.html)

You can download from this [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/)

If necessary, then in the folder there is an implementation of the logic "log7400" from another user, but over the years I could not find it.

General form
